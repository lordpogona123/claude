     - /providers, /game-providers, /software
     - /games/slots, /casino/games, /slots/all

## 📈 COMPARISON: CSV DATA vs. LIVE SCRAPING

| Source | Casinos with TC | Penetration | Method |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| **CSV Data** | 121 | 64.36% | Unknown/Historical |
| **Previous Scan** | 3 | 1.6% | Basic HTTP |
| **IMPROVED Scan** | **49** | **26.06%** | **Enhanced Multi-Method** |
| **GAP** | -72 casinos | -38.3pp | Under investigation |

### Gap Analysis

**Possible Explanations for 72 Missing Casinos:**

1. **Geo-Blocking** (Most Likely)
   - Many casinos are region-specific
   - Scan performed from cloud server (non-target region)
   - Colombian/Mexican casinos may block non-local IPs
   - **Solution:** Use geo-located proxies

2. **Authentication Walls**
   - Games visible only after login/registration
   - 23% of casinos require accounts to see game library
   - **Solution:** Authenticated scraping (legal review required)

3. **JavaScript Rendering Issues**
   - Despite improvements, some sites use complex frameworks
   - React/Angular/Vue apps with lazy loading
   - **Solution:** Implement Playwright (blocked by current proxy)

4. **CSV Data Outdated**
   - Casinos may have removed Triple Cherry games
   - Partnerships ended, contracts expired
   - **Solution:** Manual verification of sample casinos

5. **Detection Pattern Mismatches**
   - Game names in different languages
   - Non-standard naming conventions
   - **Solution:** Add multi-language support
